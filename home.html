            The computer salesperson directs the customer to the laptop section. <br>
            While they walk in the same direction, the customer becomes nostalgic.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            I remember clearly, going to the computer store when I was younger and seeing an
            army of shiny screens standing in line on the desks. A few of them were shut down;
            just black and shiny, waiting for someone to switch them on. The rest of the screens
            were a moving swarm of mesmerising screensavers. Occasionally some customers
            dared to touch them and suddenly stop the hypnotic animation. They would then
            enter the computer’s interface, finding a way through the unfriendly visuals and all
            the technological terms.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson listens.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Can I touch it?
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson maintains a healthy level of eye contact <br>with the
            customer and keeps listening.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            I remember being very fatigued by the language used on the computer’s interface
            at first, it seemed very distant and emotionless. Even the word ‘interface’ seemed
            very abstract and unclear to me, that was until recently, when I became a
            ‘web-developer’.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The customer forms air quotes with their fingers.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Back then, it sounded the same as interbase, metaface, webface, datameta,
            metatag, dataspace, interpixel, interform and so on. It was abstract yet so generic
            and familiar it would almost frustrate me. The reassuring moment would come when
            I would be browsing on the visual internet, going from website to website, with warm,
            original and personal graphics.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson listens.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            I was wondering if I could try to go on the internet using an installed browser?
            I would like to experience it here in the store, if possible.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Sure, you may.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            They both remain silent for a bit.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            What do you think makes a good website?
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Mmm. The internet with its websites is an abundant and hectic place… What is the
            difference between a website that leaves you uncommitted and aloof, and another
            one that fully immerses you? Is a good website one that clashes with its
            neighbouring websites, the ones that are open in the other tabs? Is good design a
            perfect amount of disharmony and familiarity?
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            I always wondered why I would consider a website well designed. I realised I am
            more sensitive to a website that evokes a conflict with the rest of the websites
            surrounding it. MMmmh. Sort of metaphorically zooming out and seeing all the
            websites, comparing them and finding similarities, to figure out the patterns, and to
            question them by breaking them. A good design shows the unnoticeable, the never
            questioned detail, and makes your initial view shift to the medium itself.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Yes! Absolutely.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            With the tips of their fingers, gently pushing on the keyboard, <br> 
            the computer salesperson types the name of a website in the search bar and presses enter.  <br> 
            The page takes a few seconds, maybe even a minute to load.  <br> 
            They both stare at the white window, waiting, more titillated than impatient.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            It’s the highest peak of excitement! At this stage, the website can still be anything.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Yes! There are two particular feelings I love the most when online. First, when
            entering a website and it seems a bit chaotic, but after some time clicking, hovering,
            loading, refreshing, scrolling down, scrolling up again, going back and forth between
            pages, spending some time with it, you start to understand its system and identity,
            and it makes you feel you are part of something.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The customer nods in agreement. The computer salesperson goes on:
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            The second feeling is probably my favourite one. It can sound a bit outdated, but I
            still happen to feel it; it’s the moment of excitement when you can’t access the
            website straight away, but you start imagining what this website could actually be.
            For example when someone, say a customer, narrates a particular web experience,
            the mental imagery occurs and you start projecting - now you have to wait before the
            online moment. There is a word to name this anticipation in German. It’s die
            Vorfreude, which could be translated as pre-happiness. You have to wait patiently, to
            type the URL and see the website loading. Sometimes…
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The salesperson starts giggling.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            …the excitement can be so strong that mistakes appear when typing the URL,
leading to different or dead websites.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The website is still loading. They are still talking and staring at the white screen, <br>
faces in the same direction.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            I remember websites that would take so long to load, that I would open them in a
            new tab and wait nervously. I would wait longer to be sure it was fully loaded and I
            could enjoy every scroll and click.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Loading time is usually avoided as much as possible by web developers, using
complicated technologies to be as fast and efficient as possible. “Slow-loading
websites reduce customer engagement and hence, the average time that users
spend interacting with your site” (Choudhary). Loading is sometimes perceived as
badly coded. I am personally not particularly interested in speed technologies. I
actually enjoy a slow website, it feels almost more precious, more fragile. I like to
imagine the thinking process of the human behind the code. I like the slow web
moment, loading for a while, potentially with a loader that has been designed and
thought of. I feel affection towards artist J. R. Carpenter’s definition of the handmade
web. She says “I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to refer to web pages coded by
hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather
than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or
one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design,
ownership, privacy, security, or identity”.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The customer marks a pause and quotes further, with a serious tone:
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            “I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to suggest slowness and smallness as forms of
resistance”.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson nods. The thought starts growing.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Yes. I also enjoy a website that has been slowly manually coded, as the website’s
            imperfections pop up. Small mistakes and typographical errors, a misplaced
            element. A website that isn’t functioning optimally nor fully automated or updated.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Since a website cannot be static and carved in stone, it’s destined to be obsolete
            eventually, it needs maintenance to update the files, the technologies. The website
            evolves, grows, reduces. It needs care throughout time, otherwise it will vanish. The
            vanishing glitches can also be beautiful. Letting go of human control and seeing how
            the website will evolve on its own.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            On the other hand, I love to see handmade websites that are constantly reshaped
            through small changes here and there but most of all with care.
            A bit like a room that you clean up, where you add posters to the wall and place
            objects on the shelf. The great thing about creating your own website is that you can
            update and change its style anytime.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            There are endless possibilities, the scale of the website is unlimited! It can have
            thousands of fixed pages or just a single very wide one in which you can scroll
            endlessly from left to right.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Learning coding is very liberating because you learn to publish your content to the
            world straight away. As Laurel Schwulst says “a website creator becomes both
            author and architect simultaneously”. You can create the content and build the
            container where it will be received. I think it’s important to make coding as accessible
            as possible, to demystify this sometimes unapproachable technology.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson changes their voice slightly to a more solemn tone.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            This reminds me of what the Science Fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin has written:
            “Anybody who ever lighted a fire without matches has probably gained some proper
            respect for ‘low’ or ‘primitive’ or ‘simple’ technologies; anybody who ever lighted a
            fire with matches should have the wits to respect that notable hi-tech invention”. As
            she further explains, physical objects around us are also ‘technology’ as if “paper,
            ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural objects, born with us
            like our teeth and fingers -- as if steel saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece
            vests spun from recycled glass grew on trees, and we just picked them when they
            were ripe”. They are made and modified by humans for humans. She expands the
            definition of technology. I can see a similarity with the handmade web, coded by
            humans rather than software. Learning to code slowly by hand also makes this
            digital technology more palpable, accessible and less abstract. Learning to code
            slowly by hand changes your perception of the web and your participation in it.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The customer listens attentively, excitedly, and suddenly the loading website starts to
            unfold. They both look into the screen and stop talking for a bit. They stare at the
            arrow-shaped cursor that regularly changes into a pointing finger when it hovers over
            a link. The rhythm of navigation changes by becoming highly precise since the links
            are very small to catch, the cursor moving slowly, almost caressing each pixel of the
            screen. The computer salesperson takes the customer’s right hand and guides it with
            the mouse, in silence. They know how to navigate a website but they tacitly agree to
            continue collectively. One hand moves the mouse, the other hand slowly and
            delicately scrolls down the page. The pulse of their heartbeats is speeding up. They
            start to wonder, what stands at the top corners? What is the bottom right pixel like?
            How is the webpage structured? As the elements of the interface become more and
            more clear, they can immediately identify:
            <ul>
                <li>A header: the top banner, usually a rectangular shape, taking up the whole
                    width of the screen, fixed, with the name of the website, sometimes promoting
                    an offer.</li>
                <li>A footer: the bottom part, at the very end of the website, with useful links,
                    legal content, well organised, with a structure that is always the same.</li>
                <li>A burger menu: it is usually a little icon that looks like a simplified burger
                    pictured as three lines on top of each other with equal spacing in between.
                    When clicked, it opens the menu for the user to access the main pages.</li>
                <li>A main image: when entering the site, an almost full screen wide image that
                    sets the tone.</li>
                <li>A scroll bar: by default it is placed on the right of the screen, to bring the user
                    from top to bottom.</li>
                <li>A favicon: the icon or logo of the website in the browser’s address bar,
                    maximum 10 pixels height.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            I always wondered why the web of today looks so flat, sleek, and repetitive. It
            leaves me with a feeling of emptiness, passivity and slight alienation. I have no
            browsing memory at all.

            The customer who is feeling a sense of togetherness:
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Because most website architecture is based on default templates and all have the
            same structure. I came across the book <i>Don’t Make Me Think</i> by Steve Krug and
            understood that there are rules: websites should have a navigation that feels as
            intuitive as possible, users should be able to scroll through websites with minimum
            effort, without having to think. It has to be fast and without friction.

            Sometimes clients and designers seek to mimic this ‘robotic approach’, with its
            template-like design. With wide sliders, wide images, automated opening menus,
            infinite scroll etc. I wonder, is the robotic really that reassuring?

            the main door opening and closing automatically,  <br>noticing the height of the ceiling,
            how the neon lights are placed precisely,  <br>and the sound of a colleague opening

            I think there is a difference between going on a website in a shop or at home.
            Computers are spaces within spaces. We need to consider the environment in which
            the computer you’re visiting a website on is placed. As I said, looking at a website in
            … a library is not the same as seeing a website from the softness of your bed.
            When you move your laptop, you move all the digital spaces that are open in your
            browser along with it. You browse, you close your laptop, you physically relocate
            somewhere else, you open your laptop again, and you re-discover the browsed
            website, in another space, in another room.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            They decide to carry the laptop to a separate room in the shop to have another look. <br>
            They first remove their united hands from the mouse, close the laptop, hold it, <br> and
            walk to the room together. One holding the laptop, one holding the mouse and its
            cable.  <br>The other room is dimly lit. The walls are closer together and the ceiling is
            much lower,  <br>forcing them to almost sit on their knees. They open the laptop again.
            <br>The computer screen switches on,  they rediscover and re-enter the recently visited
            page.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            I often think of websites as spaces, more specifically, I think of them as houses.
            And the web pages … as rooms.

        <div class="actions">
            The customer nods.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Mmm. When creating a website, you need to define its navigation, its structure,
            how you enter and access the pages.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            They type ‘house’ in the search bar and press enter.
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            <i>house</i>, noun: <br>
            1.  <br>A building for human habitation, <br>
            especially one that consists of a ground floor  <br>and one or more upper storeys. <br>
            2.  <br>A building in which people meet for a particular activity.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            When you enter a house you have never visited, most of the time, you can
            immediately sense where the different rooms are. You understand relatively quickly
            where the kitchen is and what you are supposed to do there. The living room is the
            place for relaxing and socialising. The toilets are usually at the end of a corridor or
            close to the shower bathroom if not merged together. Every space is strictly defined
            and has a specific function. When you enter a house you get an atmosphere straight
            away. You get a sense of the space, guided by the colours, the visuals, the lighting,
            whether things are in order, or if it is messy.

        <div class="actions">
            The customer is interested.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            A house, like a website, takes time to be built, and it has to be carefully thought
            through to hold together. Like a house, a website can be restored, renovated, or may
            perish — it needs maintenance. Like a house, it is located physically, on a server. It
            will then be accessed via its URL; like a house, a website has a precise address.
            Like a house, it has some invisible yet fundamental technologies necessary for it to
            function properly, like electricity and water pipes …
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            They both reflect together, looking around the physical space they are in and going
            through the website. Even the dictionary website they were just visiting now
            becomes a subject of analysis. They search for images. All the houses they see
            evoke for them a stereotypical website with a specific aesthetic and functionality: the
            American house, the tiny house, the palace, the modernist house, the cabin, the
            Pippi Longstocking house, and so on.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            When you are the person thinking about the architecture of the website, you
            immediately think of the future navigation through the pages. There will be an
            entrance, a starting page that’s actually called the homepage. How do you walk
            through the homepage? Is it a squeezed or a monumental entrance? You also need
            to think of how to travel from one page to the next one or to the subpage.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Adding a new page to a website, a new tab, is like adding a new room. Adding
            more content to a page can be considered as adding more items to this room.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Like for a house, you need to think of general harmony between every room (every
            page). What is being repeated or is going to be alternating? The colours, the
            materials, the furniture, the sense of space?
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            They go back to the first website. The reflection of the screen in their eyes changes
with the loading of the page.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Look, the header for example. I like to see the header as a roof. Or maybe the attic.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            And the footer as the cellar.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            The menu as the stairs bringing you through the different rooms.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            The scroll bar as the elevator.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            The favicon as the name on a postal box.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            I like to see the hovering as the temptation of an open door. You can enter it, it’s
            showing you the potential of an accessible room close by. Will you choose to enter?
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The computer salesperson nods.
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Now I wonder, do you want to enter the website through the usual entrance?
        </div>
        <div class="actions">
            The customer hesitates.
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            If a website is a house I can build, how would I curate it?
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Do you want to use the default doors to move from one room to another
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Or instead a small hole in the wall
        </div>
        <div class="salesperson">
            Like a rat hole
        </div>
        <div class="customer end1">
            Hidden behind a little curtain
        </div>
        <div class="customer end2">
            Even smaller
        </div>
        <div class="customer end3">
            Or navigating your house from above rather than through the doors
        </div>
        <div class="customer end4">
            From the point of view of the ceiling
        </div>
        <div class="customer end5">
            Why not have the ceiling a bit closer to the ground
        </div>
        <div class="customer end6">
            Having a house where running is the only acceptable way of navigating
        </div>
        <div class="customer">
            Or having endless hidden content,
        </div>
        <div class="customer end2">
            Things you can search instead of being presented with a recommended feed
        </div>
        <div class="customer end7">
            Storing memories in the kitchen rather than on the living room shelf
        </div>
        <div class="customer end4">
            Keeping the stairs but removing the rooms
        </div>
        <div class="customer end2">
            Remove the stairs and have an elevator instead
        </div>
        <div class="customer end1">
            Having a guest book
        </div>
        <div class="customer end5">
            A hidden box of memories
        </div>
        <div class="customer end6">
            A friend’s room
        </div>
        <div class="customer end8">
            A house that is not a house anymore
        </div>
        <div class="customer end5">
            A website that feels like a building that feels like home
        </div>
        <div class="customer end4">
            Having all the content hidden in the scroll bar
        </div>
